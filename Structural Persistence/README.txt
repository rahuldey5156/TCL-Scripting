Step 1. Identify the no. of chains in the protein
Step 2. Calculate the SP of each chain
Step 3. Compute the average SP value across all chains at each frame to determine the overall SP for the protein

#########

Our protein has 5 chains. So we calculate the SP of all the 5 chains and then calculate the average SP across all chains using the Python script

Requirements:
1) pdb file
2) xtc file
